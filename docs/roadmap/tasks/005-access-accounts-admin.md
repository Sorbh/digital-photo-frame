## Overview
Create comprehensive admin interface for managing access accounts including account creation, editing, deletion, and folder assignment using a visual grid interface. This provides the administrative control center for the entire access accounts system.

## Current State
- Admin panel exists with basic functionality
- No access account management interface
- Folder management exists but no association system
- Current admin authentication system in place

## Target State
- New "Access Accounts" section in admin panel
- Create/edit account forms with name and PIN fields
- Visual grid interface for folder assignment with checkboxes
- List view of all accounts with management actions
- Integration with existing admin authentication and styling

## Implementation Steps

### Backend Changes
1. Implement complete CRUD API endpoints for access accounts
2. Add folder listing API for assignment grid
3. Validate PIN uniqueness across accounts
4. Handle concurrent access to account data
5. Add admin-only middleware to protect account endpoints

### Frontend Changes
1. Create admin access accounts page with navigation integration
2. Build account creation form with validation
3. Implement folder assignment grid with checkboxes
4. Create account list view with edit/delete actions
5. Add form validation and error handling
6. Integrate with existing admin styling and components

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Form validation, API integration, data handling
- **Integration Tests**: Full CRUD workflows, folder assignment
- **Manual Testing**: Admin user workflows, error scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Admin can create new access accounts with name and PIN
- [ ] Visual grid shows all folders with checkbox selection
- [ ] Admin can assign multiple folders to one account
- [ ] Admin can assign one folder to multiple accounts
- [ ] Admin can edit existing accounts (name, PIN, folder assignments)
- [ ] Admin can delete accounts with confirmation
- [ ] Form validation prevents duplicate PINs and invalid data

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Follows existing admin panel design patterns
- [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Integration with existing admin authentication
- [ ] Performance optimization for large folder lists

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Matches existing admin panel styling and layout
- [ ] Intuitive folder selection with clear visual feedback
- [ ] Form validation with helpful error messages
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Loading states during API operations

## Files Involved

### New Files to Create
```
client/admin/access-accounts.html
client/admin/css/access-accounts.css
client/admin/js/access-accounts.js
server/tests/accessAccountController.test.js
```

### Existing Files to Modify
```
client/admin/index.html (navigation links)
client/admin/css/admin.css (shared styling)
server/controllers/accessAccountController.js (complete implementation)
server/routes/api.js (add all CRUD endpoints)
```

### Documentation Updates
```
docs/frontend/specs/components.md (admin interface updates)
docs/backend/specs/api.md (endpoint documentation)
```

## Dependencies and Integration

### Prerequisites
- Task 002A: Access Accounts Foundation Setup (must be completed)

### Impacts
- Enables Task 002C: PIN Authentication System
- Provides admin control for Task 002D: Image Filtering

### API Contracts
- Implements all admin endpoints from `docs/shared/contracts/access-accounts-api.md`
- Uses existing folder API for assignment grid

### External Dependencies
- Existing admin authentication system
- Current folder management APIs
- Admin panel styling framework

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Follow existing admin page patterns and structure
- Reuse admin authentication and session management
- Integrate with current admin navigation system

### Security
- Admin-only access to all account management endpoints
- Validate all inputs on both client and server side
- Protect against concurrent modification conflicts

### Performance
- Optimize folder grid for large numbers of folders
- Implement client-side caching for folder list
- Use efficient DOM manipulation for grid updates

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Command to run relevant tests
npm test server/tests/accessAccount*
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create account with name and PIN validation
- [ ] Assign folders using checkbox grid interface
- [ ] Edit existing accounts and modify folder assignments
- [ ] Delete accounts with proper confirmation
- [ ] Handle error states and network failures
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Implementation Notes

### Potential Challenges
- Creating intuitive folder assignment grid interface
- Managing state synchronization between form and grid
- Handling large numbers of folders efficiently
- Integrating with existing admin panel architecture

### Alternative Approaches
- Multi-select dropdown (rejected for poor UX with many folders)
- Separate page for folder assignment (rejected for workflow efficiency)

### Future Considerations
- Bulk operations for multiple accounts
- Import/export functionality for account configurations
- Enhanced folder organization and filtering
